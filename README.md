# goit-js-hw-10

Fifth homework in JavaScript module in GoIT course.

## General info

In this part I've learned about HTTP protocol, REST API, AJAX and pagination.

The webside is a cat search engine where you simply search cats. After choosing
one it displays the image of a cat with a simple desription. The HTTP request
where made using axios librery and if there was a problem with a server
connection the statement was made using Notiflix.

To hide secret data that is needed to communicate with server program store this
in .env file and uses dotenv library to get taht data from it.
